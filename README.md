This html code page for use in my domain (perhaps yours too) was a project that started in chat-gpt as a simple youtube iframe canvas that had one slider that controlled a bunch of glitch effects overlayed ontop of any youtube video,
it is now 100% Complete and features two verry special Suggested links if you dont want to use your own link you have for a video (youtube video) and I have used Google's Gemini Coding Companion to use other effects , other than the original pages chat-gpt suggested ones, it has now got a whole selection of sliders for each different effects aspect (scripted), AND AN AUTO GLITCH BUTTON TO START THE EFFECT OFF,
AND A RANDOMIZE BUTTON TO RANDOMIZE THE EFFECT PALLET.
